# Electronics Customer Behavior & Revenue Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior in the electronics retail domain using PostgreSQL, Python, and Power BI. The objective is to derive actionable insights related to revenue trends, customer loyalty, discount effectiveness, satisfaction levels, and demographic behavior.

---

## Business Problem
Electronics retailers collect large volumes of transactional and customer data but often lack clarity on:
- Revenue contribution by different customer segments
- Effectiveness of discounts in driving high-value purchases
- Impact of loyalty programs and memberships
- Customer satisfaction drivers across products and services

This project converts raw data into meaningful insights to support data-driven decision-making.

## Business Questions and Solutions

### 1. How does total revenue vary by gender?
SQL aggregation was used to calculate total revenue generated by male and female customers.

---

### 2. Do discounted customers still generate high spending?
Customers who used discounts and spent more than the average total spend were identified to evaluate discount effectiveness.

---

### 3. Which product categories have the highest customer satisfaction?
Average satisfaction scores were calculated by product category to identify top-performing categories.

---

### 4. How do regions perform in terms of revenue and store ratings?
Regional analysis was performed to compare average revenue and store ratings across different regions.

---

### 5. Does membership status influence spending and loyalty?
Average total spend and loyalty scores were compared across membership statuses to assess membership value.

---

### 6. Which product categories offer the highest average discounts?
Average discount percentages and total items purchased were analyzed by product category.

---

### 7. How can customers be segmented based on loyalty score?
Customers were segmented into Bronze, Silver, and Gold groups based on loyalty score thresholds to analyze revenue contribution.

---

### 8. Which age group contributes the highest revenue?
Customers were divided into four age groups using Python, and revenue contribution was analyzed for each group.

---

### 9. Does opting for a warranty extension affect satisfaction?
Average satisfaction scores were compared for customers with and without warranty extensions.

---

### 10. What is the best visit time for maximizing revenue and satisfaction?
